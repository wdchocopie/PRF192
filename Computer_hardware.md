# Computer hardware (Check CEA + CSI)

----
# Type of buses

* Adress bus : Determine the IO peripherals, position of accessed memory
* Data bus : Transmit data
* Control bus : Determine operation on peripherals, read peripheral's states

# Step to read a memory cell
1. CPU put the memory address to address bus
2. CPU put the read-signal to control bus
3. Data in memory cell is transferred to a register in CPU
